## Section 1: Parameters and Estimates
### Exercise 1. Polling - expected value of S
Suppose you poll a population in which a proportion $p$ of voters are Democrats and $1−p$ are Republicans. Your sample size is $N=25$. Consider the random variable $S$, which is the total number of Democrats in your sample.

What is the expected value of this random variable $S$?

**Answer:** $E(S)=25p$

### Exercise 2. Polling - standard error of S
Again, consider the random variable $S$, which is the total number of Democrats in your sample of 25 voters. The variable $p$ describes the proportion of Democrats in the sample, whereas $1−p$ describes the proportion of Republicans.

What is the standard error of $S$?

**Anser:** $SE(S)=\sqrt{25p\left ( 1-p \right )}$

### Exercise 3. Polling - expected value of X-bar
Consider the random variable $S/N$, which is equivalent to the sample average that we have been denoting as $\bar{X}$. The variable $N$ represents the sample size and $p$ is the proportion of Democrats in the population.

What is the expected value of $\bar{X}$?

**Answer:** $E(\bar{X})=p$

### Exercise 4. Polling - standard error of X-bar
What is the standard error of the sample average, $\bar{X}$?

The variable $N$ represents the sample size and $p$ is the proportion of Democrats in the population.

**Answer:** $SE(\bar{X})=\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}$

### Exercise 5. se versus p
Write a line of code that calculates the standard error $se$ of a sample average when you poll 25 people in the population. Generate a sequence of 100 proportions of Democrats $p$ that vary from 0 (no Democrats) to 1 (all Democrats).

Plot $se$ versus $p$ for the 100 different proportions.

- Use the $seq$ function to generate a vector of 100 values of $p$ that range from 0 to 1.
- Use the $sqrt$ function to generate a vector of standard errors for all values of $p$.
- Use the $plot$ function to generate a plot with $p$ on the x-axis and $se$ on the y-axis.

```{r}
# `N` represents the number of people polled
N <- 25

# Create a variable `p` that contains 100 proportions ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function
p <- seq(from=0, to =1, length=100)

# Create a variable `se` that contains the standard error of each sample average
se <- sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)

# Plot `p` on the x-axis and `se` on the y-axis
plot(p,se)
```

### Exercise 6. Multiple plots of se versus p
Using the same code as in the previous exercise, create a for-loop that generates three plots of $p$ versus $se$ when the sample sizes equal $N=25$, $N=100$, and $N=1000$

- Your for-loop should contain two lines of code to be repeated for three different values of N.
- The first line within the for-loop should use the $sqrt$ function to generate a vector of standard errors $se$ for all values of $p$.
- The second line within the for-loop should use the $plot$ function to generate a plot with $p$ on the x-axis and $se$ on the y-axis.
- Use the $ylim$ argument to keep the y-axis limits constant across all three plots. The lower limit should be equal to 0 and the upper limit should equal 0.1 (it can be shown that this value is the highest  calculated standard error across all values of $p$ and $N$).
```{r}
# The vector `p` contains 100 proportions of Democrats ranging from 0 to 1 using the `seq` function
p <- seq(0, 1, length = 100)

# The vector `sample_sizes` contains the three sample sizes
sample_sizes <- c(25, 100, 1000)

# Write a for-loop that calculates the standard error `se` for every value of `p` for each of the three samples sizes `N` in the vector `sample_sizes`. Plot the three graphs, using the `ylim` argument to standardize the y-axis across all three plots.

for(x in sample_sizes){
  se <- sqrt(p * (1-p)/x)
  plot(p,se)
  
}
```

### Exercise 7. Expected value of d
Our estimate for the difference in proportions of Democrats and Republicans is $d=\bar{X}-(1-\bar{X})$.

Which derivation correctly uses the rules we learned about sums of random variables and scaled random variables to derive the expected value of $d$?

**Asnwer:**
$E[\bar{X}-(1-\bar{X})]=E[2\bar{X}-1]=2E[\bar{X}]-1=2p-1=p-(1-p)$

### Exercise 8. Standard error of d
Our estimate for the difference in proportions of Democrats and Republicans is $d=\bar{X}-(1-\bar{X})$.

Which derivation correctly uses the rules we learned about sums of random variables and scaled random variables to derive the standard error of $d$?

**Answer:** 
$SE[\bar{X}-(1-\bar{X})]=SE[2\bar{X}-1]=2SE[\bar{X}]=2\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}$

### Exercise 9. Standard error of the spread
Say the actual proportion of Democratic voters is $p=0.45$. In this case, the Republican party is winning by a relatively large margin of $d=−0.1$, or a 10% margin of victory. What is the standard error of the spread $2\bar{X}-1$ in this case?

- Use the $sqrt$ function to calculate the standard error of the spread $2\bar{X}-1$.

```{r}
# `N` represents the number of people polled
N <- 25

# `p` represents the proportion of Democratic voters
p <- 0.45

# Calculate the standard error of the spread. Print this value to the console.
2*sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)
```
### Exercise 10. Sample size
So far we have said that the difference between the proportion of Democratic voters and Republican voters is about 10% and that the standard error of this spread is about 0.2 when $N=25$. Select the statement that explains why this sample size is sufficient or not.

**Answer: This sample size is too small because the standard error is larger than the spread.**

## Section 2: The Central Limit Theorem in Practice
### Exercise 1. Sample average
Write function called $take\_sample$ that takes the proportion of Democrats $p$ and the sample size $N$ as arguments and returns the sample average of Democrats (1) and Republicans (0).

Calculate the sample average if the proportion of Democrats equals 0.45 and the sample size is 100.

- Define a function called $take\_sample$ that takes $p$ and $N$ as arguments.
- Use the $sample$ function as the first statement in your function to sample $N$ elements from a vector of options where Democrats are assigned the value '1' and Republicans are assigned the value '0' in that order.
- Use the $mean$ function as the second statement in your function to find the average value of the random sample.
```{r}
# Write a function called `take_sample` that takes `p` and `N` as arguements and returns the average value of a randomly sampled population.
take_sample <- function (p, N){
    res <- sample(c(1,0),N, replace=TRUE,prob=c(p,1-p))
    mean(res)
}

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

# Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <- 100

# Call the `take_sample` function to determine the sample average of `N` randomly selected people from a population containing a proportion of Democrats equal to `p`. Print this value to the console.
take_sample(p,N)
```
### Exercise 2. Distribution of errors - 1
Assume the proportion of Democrats in the population $p$ equals 0.45 and that your sample size $N$ is 100 polled voters. The $take\_sample$ function you defined previously generates our estimate, $\bar{X}$.

Replicate the random sampling 10,000 times and calculate $p-\bar{X}$ for each random sample. Save these differences as a vector called $errors$. Find the average of $errors$ and plot a histogram of the distribution.

- The function $take\_sample$ that you defined in the previous exercise has already been run for you.
- Use the $replicate$ function to replicate subtracting the result of $take\_sample$ from the value of p 10,000 times.
- Use the $mean$ function to calculate the average of the differences between the sample average and actual value of $p$.
```{r}
# Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <- 100

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the sample to be replicated
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

# Create an objected called `errors` that replicates subtracting the result of the `take_sample` function from `p` for `B` replications
errors <- replicate(B,p-take_sample(p,N))

# Calculate the mean of the errors. Print this value to the console.
mean(errors)
```
### Exercise 3. Distribution of errors - 2
In the last exercise, you made a vector of differences between the actual value for $p$ and an estimate, $\bar{X}$. We called these differences between the actual and estimated values errors.

The $errors$ object has already been loaded for you. Use the $hist$ function to plot a histogram of the values contained in the vector $errors$. Which statement best describes the distribution of the errors?

**Answer: The errors are symmetrically distributed around 0.**

### Exercise 4. Average size of error
The error $p-\bar{X}$ is a random variable. In practice, the error is not observed because we do not know the actual proportion of Democratic voters, $p$. However, we can describe the size of the error by constructing a simulation.

What is the average size of the error if we define the size by taking the absolute value $\left |p-\bar{X} \right |$?

- Use the $sample$ code to generate errors, a vector of $\left |p-\bar{X} \right |$∣.
- Calculate the absolute value of $errors$ using the $abs$ function.
- Calculate the average of these values using the $mean$ function.

```{r}
# Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <- 100

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the sample to be replicated
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

# We generated `errors` by subtracting the estimate from the actual proportion of Democratic voters
errors <- replicate(B, p - take_sample(p, N))

# Calculate the mean of the absolute value of each simulated error. Print this value to the console.
mean(abs(errors))
```
### Exercise 5. Standard deviation of the spread
The standard error is related to the typical size of the error we make when predicting. We say size because, as we just saw, the errors are centered around 0. In that sense, the typical error is 0. For mathematical reasons related to the central limit theorem, we actually use the standard deviation of $errors$ rather than the average of the absolute values.

As we have discussed, the standard error is the square root of the average squared distance $\left ( \bar{X}-p^{2} \right )$. The standard deviation is defined as the square root of the distance squared.

Calculate the standard deviation of the spread.

- Use the sample code to generate $errors$, a vector of $\left | p-\bar{X} \right |$.
- Use ^2 to square the distances.
- Calculate the average squared distance using the $mean$ function.
- Calculate the square root of these values using the $sqrt$ function.
```{r}
# Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <- 100

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the sample to be replicated
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

# We generated `errors` by subtracting the estimate from the actual proportion of Democratic voters
errors <- replicate(B, p - take_sample(p, N))

# Calculate the standard deviation of `errors`
sqrt(mean(errors^2))
```
### Exercise 6. Estimating the standard error
The theory we just learned tells us what this standard deviation is going to be because it is the standard error of $\bar{X}$.

Estimate the standard error given an expected value of 0.45 and a sample size of 100.

- Calculate the standard error using the $sqrt$ function

```{r}
# Define `p` as the expected value equal to 0.45
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the sample size
N <- 100

# Calculate the standard error
sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)
```
### Exercise 7. Standard error of the estimate
In practice, we don't know $p$, so we construct an estimate of the theoretical prediction based by plugging in $\bar{X}$ for $p$. Calculate the standard error of the estimate:

\[\hat{SE}\left ( \bar{X} \right )\]

- Simulate a poll $X$ using the $sample$ function.
- When using the $sample$ function, create a vector using $c()$ that contains all possible polling options where '1' indicates a Democratic voter and '0' indicates a Republican voter.
- When using the $sample$ function, use $replace = TRUE$ within the $sample$ function to indicate that sampling from the vector should occur with replacement.
- When using the $sample$ function, use $prob =$ within the $sample$ function to indicate the probabilities of selecting either element (0 or 1) within the vector of possibilities.
- Use the $mean$ function to calculate the average of the simulated poll, $\bar{X}$.
- Calculate the standard error of the $\bar{X}$ using the $sqrt$ function and print the result.

```{r}
# Define `p` as a proportion of Democratic voters to simulate
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the sample size
N <- 100

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

# Define `X` as a random sample of `N` voters with a probability of picking a Democrat ('1') equal to `p`
X <- sample(c(1,0),N,replace=TRUE,prob=c(p,1-p))

# Define `X_bar` as the average sampled proportion
X_bar <- mean(X)

# Calculate the standard error of the estimate. Print the result to the console.
sqrt(X_bar*(1-X_bar)/N)
```
### Exercise 8. Plotting the standard error
The standard error estimates obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation, the theoretical prediction, and the estimate of the theoretical prediction are all very close, which tells us that the theory is working. This gives us a practical approach to knowing the typical error we will make if we predict $p$ with $\hat{X}$. The theoretical result gives us an idea of how large a sample size is required to obtain the precision we need. Earlier we learned that the largest standard errors occur for $p=0.5$.

Create a plot of the largest standard error for $N$ ranging from 100 to 5,000. Based on this plot, how large does the sample size have to be to have a standard error of about 1%?

```{r}
N <- seq(100, 5000, len = 100)
p <- 0.5
se <- sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)
```
**Answer: 2500**

### Exercise 9. Distribution of X-hat
For $N=100$, the central limit theorem tells us that the distribution of $\hat{X}$ is...

**Answer: approximately normal with expected value $p$ and standard error** $\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}$.

### Exercise 10. Distribution of the errors
We calculated a vector $errors$ that contained, for each simulated sample, the difference between the actual value p and our estimate $\hat{X}$.

The errors $\hat{X}-p$ are:

**Answer: approximately normal with expected value $0$ and standard error** $\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}$

### Exercise 11. Plotting the errors
Make a qq-plot of the $errors$ you generated previously to see if they follow a normal distribution.

- Run the supplied code
- Use the $qqnorm$ function to produce a qq-plot of the errors.
- Use the $qqline$ function to plot a line showing a normal distribution.
```{r}
# Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <- 100

# The variable `B` specifies the number of times we want the sample to be replicated
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

# Generate `errors` by subtracting the estimate from the actual proportion of Democratic voters
errors <- replicate(B, p - take_sample(p, N))

# Generate a qq-plot of `errors` with a qq-line showing a normal distribution
qqnorm(errors)
qqline(errors)
```

### Exercise 12. Estimating the probability of a specific value of X-bar
If $p=0.45$ and $N=100$, use the central limit theorem to estimate the probability that $\bar{X}>0.5$.

- Use $pnorm$ to define the probability that a value will be greater than 0.5.
```{r}
# Define `p` as the proportion of Democrats in the population being polled
p <- 0.45

# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <- 100

# Calculate the probability that the estimated proportion of Democrats in the population is greater than 0.5. Print this value to the console.
1-pnorm(0.5,p,sqrt(p*(1-p)/N))
```
### Exercise 13. Estimating the probability of a specific error size
Assume you are in a practical situation and you don't know $p$. Take a sample of size $N=100$ and obtain a sample average of $\bar{X}=0.51$.

What is the CLT approximation for the probability that your error size is equal or larger than 0.01?

- Calculate the standard error of the sample average using the $sqrt$ function.
- Use $pnorm$ twice to define the probabilities that a value will be less than -0.01 or greater than 0.01.
- Combine these results to calculate the probability that the error size will be 0.01 or larger.
```{r}
# Define `N` as the number of people polled
N <-100

# Define `X_hat` as the sample average
X_hat <- 0.51

# Define `se_hat` as the standard error of the sample average
se_hat <- sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/N)

# Calculate the probability that the error is 0.01 or larger
(pnorm(-0.01,0,se_hat)+1-pnorm(0.01,0,se_hat))
```
## Section 3: Confidence Intervals and p-Values
### Exercise 1. Confidence interval for p
For the following exercises, we will use actual poll data from the 2016 election. The exercises will contain pre-loaded data from the $dslabs$ package.

```{r}
library(dslabs)
data("polls_us_election_2016")
```
We will use all the national polls that ended within a few weeks before the election.

Assume there are only two candidates and construct a 95% confidence interval for the election night proportion $p$.

- Use $filter$ to subset the data set for the poll data you want. Include polls that ended on or after October 31, 2016 ($enddate$). Only include polls that took place in the United States. Call this filtered object $polls$.
- Use $nrow$ to make sure you created a filtered object polls that contains the correct number of rows.
- Extract the sample size $N$ from the first poll in your subset object polls.
- Convert the percentage of Clinton voters ($rawpoll\_clinton$) from the first poll in polls to a proportion, $X\_hat$. Print this value to the console.
- Find the standard error of $X\_hat$ given $N$. Print this result to the console.
- Calculate the 95% confidence interval of this estimate using the $qnorm$ function.
- Save the lower and upper confidence intervals as an object called $ci$. Save the lower confidence interval first.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
# Load the data
data(polls_us_election_2016)

# Generate an object `polls` that contains data filtered for polls that ended on or after October 31, 2016 in the United States
polls <- polls_us_election_2016 %>% filter( enddate >= "2016-10-31" & state=="U.S.")

# How many rows does `polls` contain? Print this value to the console.
nrow(polls)

# Assign the sample size of the first poll in `polls` to a variable called `N`. Print this value to the console.
(N <- polls$samplesize[1])


# For the first poll in `polls`, assign the estimated percentage of Clinton voters to a variable called `X_hat`. Print this value to the console.
(X_hat <- polls$rawpoll_clinton[1] / 100)

# Calculate the standard error of `X_hat` and save it to a variable called `se_hat`. Print this value to the console.
(se_hat <- sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/N))

# Use `qnorm` to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of Clinton voters. Save the lower and then the upper confidence interval to a variable called `ci`.
ci<-  X_hat + se_hat * c(-qnorm(.975),qnorm(.975))
```
### Exercise 2. Pollster results for p
Create a new object called $pollster\_results$ that contains the pollster's name, the end date of the poll, the proportion of voters who declared a vote for Clinton, the standard error of this estimate, and the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the estimate.

- Use the $mutate$ function to define four new columns: $X\_hat$, $se\_hat$, $lower$, and $upper$. Temporarily add these columns to the $polls$ object that has already been loaded for you.
- In the $X\_hat$ column, convert the raw poll results for Clinton to a proportion.
- In the $se\_hat$ column, calculate the standard error of $X\_hat$ for each poll using the $sqrt$ function.
- In the $lower$ column, calculate the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval using the $qnorm$ function.
- In the $upper$ column, calculate the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval using the $qnorm$ function.
- Use the $select$ function to select the columns from polls to save to the new object $pollster\_results$.

```{r}
# The `polls` object that filtered all the data by date and nation has already been loaded. Examine it using the `head` function.
head(polls)

# Create a new object called `pollster_results` that contains columns for pollster name, end date, X_hat, se_hat, lower confidence interval, and upper confidence interval for each poll.

pollster_results <- polls %>% mutate(
  X_hat  = rawpoll_clinton / 100, 
  se_hat = sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/samplesize), 
  lower  = X_hat - se_hat * qnorm(0.975), 
  upper  = X_hat + se_hat * qnorm(0.975)) %>%
  select(pollster, enddate, X_hat, se_hat, lower, upper)
```
### Exercise 3. Comparing to actual results - p
The final tally for the popular vote was Clinton 48.2% and Trump 46.1%. Add a column called $hit$ to $pollster\_results$ that states if the confidence interval included the true proportion $p=0.482$ or not. What proportion of confidence intervals included $p$?

- Use the $mutate$ function to define a new variable called 'hit'.
- Use logical expressions to determine if each values in $lower$ and $upper$ span the actual proportion.
- Use the $mean$ function to determine the average value in hit and summarize the results using $summarize$.
- Save the result as an object called $avg\_hit$.

```{r}
# The `pollster_results` object has already been loaded. Examine it using the `head` function.
head(pollster_results)

# Add a logical variable called `hit` that indicates whether the actual value exists within the confidence interval of each poll. Summarize the average `hit` result to determine the proportion of polls with confidence intervals include the actual value. Save the result as an object called `avg_hit`.
(avg_hit <- pollster_results %>% 
  mutate(hit = (lower <=0.482 & 0.482 <= upper)) %>%  
  summarise(mean(hit)))
```

### Exercise 4. Theory of confidence intervals
If these confidence intervals are constructed correctly, and the theory holds up, what proportion of confidence intervals should include $p$?

**Possible Answers**

- 0.05
- 0.31
- 0.50
- **0.95**

### Exercise 5. Confidence interval for d
A much smaller proportion of the polls than expected produce confidence intervals containing $p$. Notice that most polls that fail to include $p$ are underestimating. The rationale for this is that undecided voters historically divide evenly between the two main candidates on election day.

In this case, it is more informative to estimate the spread or the difference between the proportion of two candidates $d$, or $0.482−0.461=0.021$ for this election.

Assume that there are only two parties and that $d=2p−1$. Construct a 95% confidence interval for difference in proportions on election night.

- Use the $mutate$ function to define a new variable called 'd_hat' in $polls$ as the proportion of Clinton voters minus the proportion of Trump voters.
- Extract the sample size $N$ from the first poll in your subset object $polls$.
- Extract the difference in proportions of voters $d\_hat$ from the first poll in your subset object $polls$.
- Use the formula above to calculate $p$ from $d\_hat$. Assign $p$ to the variable $X\_hat$.
- Find the standard error of the spread given $N$. Save this as $se_hat$.
- Calculate the 95% confidence interval of this estimate of the difference in proportions, $d\_hat$, using the $qnorm$ function.
- Save the lower and upper confidence intervals as an object called $ci$. Save the lower confidence interval first.

```{r}
# Add a statement to this line of code that will add a new column named `d_hat` to `polls`. The new column should contain the difference in the proportion of voters.
polls <- polls_us_election_2016 %>% filter(enddate >= "2016-10-31" & state == "U.S.")  %>% mutate(d_hat = (rawpoll_clinton - rawpoll_trump)/100)

# Assign the sample size of the first poll in `polls` to a variable called `N`. Print this value to the console.
(N <- polls$samplesize[1])

# For the difference `d_hat` of the first poll in `polls` to a variable called `d_hat`. Print this value to the console.
(d_hat <- polls$d_hat[1])

# Assign proportion of votes for Clinton to the variable `X_hat`.
X_hat <- (d_hat + 1)/2

# Calculate the standard error of the spread and save it to a variable called `se_hat`. Print this value to the console.
(se_hat <- 2*sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/N))


# Use `qnorm` to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportions of voters. Save the lower and then the upper confidence interval to a variable called `ci`.
(ci <-d_hat + se_hat * c(-1,1) * qnorm(0.975))
```
### Exercise 6. Pollster results for d
Create a new object called $pollster\_results$ that contains the pollster's name, the end date of the poll, the difference in the proportion of voters who declared a vote either, and the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for the estimate.

- Use the $mutate$ function to define four new columns: 'X_hat', 'se_hat', 'lower', and 'upper'. Temporarily add these columns to the $polls$ object that has already been loaded for you.
- In the $X\_hat$ column, calculate the proportion of voters for Clinton using $d\_hat$.
- In the $se\_hat$ column, calculate the standard error of the spread for each poll using the $sqrt$ function.
- In the $lower$ column, calculate the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval using the $qnorm$ function.
- In the $upper$ column, calculate the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval using the $qnorm$ function.
- Use the $select$ function to select the $pollster$, $enddate$, $d\_hat$, $lower$, $upper$ columns from $polls$ to save to the new object $pollster\_results$.

```{r}
# The subset `polls` data with 'd_hat' already calculated has been loaded. Examine it using the `head` function.
head(polls)

# Create a new object called `pollster_results` that contains columns for pollster name, end date, d_hat, lower confidence interval of d_hat, and upper confidence interval of d_hat for each poll.
pollster_results <- polls %>% mutate(
  X_hat = (d_hat + 1)/2, 
  se_hat = 2*sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/samplesize), 
  lower=d_hat-se_hat*qnorm(0.975), 
  upper=d_hat+se_hat*qnorm(0.975)) %>% 
select(pollster,enddate,d_hat,lower,upper)

head(pollster_results)
```

### Exercise 7. Comparing to actual results - d
What proportion of confidence intervals for the difference between the proportion of voters included $d$, the actual difference in election day?

- Use the $mutate$ function to define a new variable within $pollster\_results$ called $hit$.
- Use logical expressions to determine if each values in $lower$ and $upper$ span the actual difference in proportions of voters.
- Use the $mean$ function to determine the average value in $hit$ and summarize the results using $summarize$.
- Save the result as an object called $avg\_hit$.

```{r}
# The `pollster_results` object has already been loaded. Examine it using the `head` function.
head(pollster_results)

# Add a logical variable called `hit` that indicates whether the actual value (0.021) exists within the confidence interval of each poll. Summarize the average `hit` result to determine the proportion of polls with confidence intervals include the actual value. Save the result as an object called `avg_hit`.
avg_hit <- pollster_results %>% mutate(hit = (lower <= 0.021 & upper >= 0.021)) %>% summarise(mean(hit))
```

### Exercise 8. Comparing to actual results by pollster
Although the proportion of confidence intervals that include the actual difference between the proportion of voters increases substantially, it is still lower that 0.95. In the next chapter, we learn the reason for this.

To motivate our next exercises, calculate the difference between each poll's estimate $\bar{d}$ and the actual $d=0.021$. Stratify this difference, or error, by pollster in a plot.

- Define a new variable $errors$ that contains the difference between the estimated difference between the proportion of voters and the actual difference on election day, 0.021.
- To create the plot of errors by pollster, add a layer with the function $geom_point$. The aesthetic mappings require a definition of the x-axis and y-axis variables. So the code looks like the example below, but you fill in the variables for $x$ and $y$.
- The last line of the example code adjusts the x-axis labels so that they are easier to read.

```
data %>% ggplot(aes(x = , y = )) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}
# The `polls` object has already been loaded. Examine it using the `head` function.
head(polls)

# Add variable called `error` to the object `polls` that contains the difference between d_hat and the actual difference on election day. Then make a plot of the error stratified by pollster.
library(ggplot2)
polls%>%mutate(error=0.021-d_hat)%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=pollster ,y=error ))+
  geom_point()+ 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

### Exercise 9. Comparing to actual results by pollster - multiple polls
Remake the plot you made for the previous exercise, but only for pollsters that took five or more polls.

You can use dplyr tools $group_by$ and $n$ to group data by a variable of interest and then count the number of observations in the groups. The function $filter$ filters data piped into it by your specified condition.

For example:

```
data %>% group_by(variable_for_grouping) 
    %>% filter(n() >= 5)
```
- Define a new variable $errors$ that contains the difference between the estimated difference between the proportion of voters and the actual difference on election day, 0.021.
- Group the data by pollster using the $group\_by$ function.
- Filter the data by pollsters with 5 or more polls.
- Use $ggplot$ to create the plot of errors by pollster.
- Add a layer with the function $geom\_point$.

```{r}
# The `polls` object has already been loaded. Examine it using the `head` function.
head(polls)

# Add variable called `error` to the object `polls` that contains the difference between d_hat and the actual difference on election day. Then make a plot of the error stratified by pollster, but only for pollsters who took 5 or more polls.
polls%>%mutate(error=0.021-d_hat)%>%group_by(pollster)%>%filter(n()>=5)%>%
ggplot(aes(x=pollster,y=error))+geom_point()
```

## Section 4: Statistical Models
### Exercise 1 - Heights Revisited
We have been using urn models to motivate the use of probability models. However, most data science applications are not related to data obtained from urns. More common are data that come from individuals. Probability plays a role because the data come from a random sample. The random sample is taken from a population and the urn serves as an analogy for the population.

Let's revisit the heights dataset. For now, consider $x$ to be the heights of all males in the data set. Mathematically speaking, $x$ is our population. Using the urn analogy, we have an urn with the values of $x$ in it.

What are the population average and standard deviation of our population?

- Execute the lines of code that create a vector $x$ that contains heights for all males in the population.
- Calculate the average of $x$.
- Calculate the standard deviation of $x$.

```{r}
# Load the 'dslabs' package and data contained in 'heights'
library(dslabs)
data(heights)

# Make a vector of heights from all males in the population
x <- heights %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>%
  .$height

# Calculate the population average. Print this value to the console.
mean(x)

# Calculate the population standard deviation. Print this value to the console.
sd(x)
```
### Exercise 2 - Sample the population of heights
Call the population average computed above μ and the standard deviation σ. Now take a sample of size 50, with replacement, and construct an estimate for μ and σ.

- Use the sample function to sample $N$ values from $x$.
- Calculate the mean of the sampled heights.
- Calculate the standard deviation of the sampled heights.
```{r}
# The vector of all male heights in our population `x` has already been loaded for you. You can examine the first six elements using `head`.
head(x)

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

# Define `N` as the number of people measured
N <- 50

# Define `X` as a random sample from our population `x`
X <- sample(x,N,replace=TRUE)

# Calculate the sample average. Print this value to the console.
(mean(X))

# Calculate the sample standard deviation. Print this value to the console.
(sd(X))
```
### Exercise 3 - Sample and Population Averages
What does the central limit theory tell us about the sample average and how it is related to μ, the population average?

**Possible Answers**

- It is identical to μ.
- **It is a random variable with expected value μ and standard error **$\sigma /\sqrt{N}$
- It is a random variable with expected value μ and standard error σ.
- It underestimates μ.

### Exercise 4 - Confidence Interval Calculation
We will use $\bar{X}$ as our estimate of the heights in the population from our sample size $N$. We know from previous exercises that the standard estimate of our error $\bar{X}-\mu$ is$[\sigma /\sqrt{N}$.

Construct a 95% confidence interval for μ.

- Use the $sd$ and $sqrt$ functions to define the standard error $se$.
- Calculate the 95% confidence intervals using the $qnorm$ function. Save the lower then the upper confidence interval to a variable called $ci$.
```{r}
# The vector of all male heights in our population `x` has already been loaded for you. You can examine the first six elements using `head`.
head(x)

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

# Define `N` as the number of people measured
N <- 50

# Define `X` as a random sample from our population `x`
X <- sample(x, N, replace = TRUE)

# Define `se` as the standard error of the estimate. Print this value to the console.
(se <- sd(X)/sqrt(N))


# Construct a 95% confidence interval for the population average based on our sample. Save the lower and then the upper confidence interval to a variable called `ci`.
(ci <- mean(X) + c(-1,1) * qnorm(0.975) * se)
```
### Exercise 5 - Monte Carlo Simulation for Heights
Now run a Monte Carlo simulation in which you compute 10,000 confidence intervals as you have just done. What proportion of these intervals include μ?

- Use the $replicate$ function to replicate the sample code for $B <- 10000$ simulations. Save the results of the replicated code to a variable called $res$. The replicated code should complete the following steps: 
-1. Use the $sample$ function to sample $N$ values from $x$. Save the sampled heights as a vector called $X$. 
-2. Create an object called $interval$ that contains the 95% confidence interval for each of the samples. Use the same formula you used in the previous exercise to calculate this interval. 
-3. Use the $between$ function to determine if μ is contained within the confidence interval of that simulation.
- Finally, use the mean function to determine the proportion of results in res that contain mu.
```{r}
# Define `mu` as the population average
mu <- mean(x)

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

# Define `N` as the number of people measured
N <- 50

# Define `B` as the number of times to run the model
B <- 10000

# Define an object `res` that contains a logical vector for simulated intervals that contain mu
res <- replicate(B, {
  X <- sample(x,N,replace=TRUE)
  interval <- mean(X) + c(-1,1) * qnorm(0.975) * sd(X)/sqrt(N)
  between(mu,interval[1],interval[2])
})


# Calculate the proportion of results in `res` that include mu. Print this value to the console.
(mean(res))
```
### Exercise 6 - Visualizing Polling Bias
In this section, we used visualization to motivate the presence of pollster bias in election polls. Here we will examine that bias more rigorously. Lets consider two pollsters that conducted daily polls and look at national polls for the month before the election.

Is there a poll bias? Make a plot of the spreads for each poll.

- Use $ggplot$ to plot the spread for each of the two pollsters.
- Define the x- and y-axes usingusing $aes()$ within the ggplot function.
- Use $geom\_boxplot$ to make a boxplot of the data.
- Use $geom\_point$ to add data points to the plot.
```{r}
# Load the libraries and data you need for the following exercises
library(dslabs)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
data("polls_us_election_2016")

# These lines of code filter for the polls we want and calculate the spreads
polls <- polls_us_election_2016 %>% 
  filter(pollster %in% c("Rasmussen Reports/Pulse Opinion Research","The Times-Picayune/Lucid") &
           enddate >= "2016-10-15" &
           state == "U.S.") %>% 
  mutate(spread = rawpoll_clinton/100 - rawpoll_trump/100) 

# Make a boxplot with points of the spread for each pollster
polls %>% ggplot(aes(pollster,spread)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_point()
```

### Exercise 7 - Defining Pollster Bias
The data do seem to suggest there is a difference between the pollsters. However, these data are subject to variability. Perhaps the differences we observe are due to chance. Under the urn model, both pollsters should have the same expected value: the election day difference, $d$.

We will model the observed data $Y_{ij}$ in the following way:

\[Y_{ij}=d+b_i+\varepsilon _{ij}\]

with $i=1,2$ indexing the two pollsters, $bi$ the bias for pollster $i$, and $\varepsilon _{ij}$ poll to poll chance variability. We assume the $\varepsilon$ are independent from each other, have expected value 0 and standard deviation $\sigma_i$ regardless of $j$.

Which of the following statements best reflects what we need to know to determine if our data fit the urn model?

**Possible Answers**

- Is $\varepsilon _{ij}=0$?
- How close are $Y_{ij}$ to $d$?
- **Is **$b1≠b2$**?**
- Are $b_1=0$ and $b_2=0$?

### Exercise 8 - Derive Expected Value
We modelled the observed data $Y_{ij}$ as:

\[Y_{ij}=d+b_i+\varepsilon _{ij}\]

On the right side of this model, only $\varepsilon_{ij}$ is a random variable. The other two values are constants.

What is the expected value of $Y_{1j}$?

**Possible Answers**

- $d+b_1$ **<=**
- $b_1+\varepsilon_{ij}$
- $d$
- $d+b_1+\varepsilon_{ij}$

### Exercise 9 - Expected Value and Standard Error of Poll 1
Suppose we define $\bar{Y}_1$ as the average of poll results from the first poll and  $\sigma_1$ as the standard deviation of the first poll.

What is the expected value and standard error of $\bar{Y}_1$?

**Possible Answers**

- The expected value is $d+b_1$ and the standard error is $\sigma_1$
- The expected value is $d$ and the standard error is - $\sigma_1/\sqrt{N_1}$
- **The expected value is **$d+b1$ **and the standard error is** $\sigma_1/\sqrt{N_1}$
- The expected value is $d$ and the standard error is $\sigma_1+\sqrt{N_1}$

### Exercise 10 - Expected Value and Standard Error of Poll 2
Now we define $\bar{Y}_2$ as the average of poll results from the second poll.

What is the expected value and standard error of $\bar{Y}_2$?

**Possible Answers**

- The expected value is $d+b2$ and the standard error is $\sigma_2$
- The expected value is $d$ and the standard error is $\sigma_2/\sqrt{N_2}$
- **The expected value is** $d+b2$ **and the standard error is** $\sigma_2/\sqrt{N_2}$
- The expected value is $d$ and the standard error is $\sigma_2+\sqrt{N_2}$


### Exercise 11 - Difference in Expected Values Between Polls
Using what we learned by answering the previous questions, what is the expected value of $\bar{Y}_2-\bar{Y}_1$?

**Possible Answers**

- $(b_2−b_1)^2$
- $b_2−b_1/\sqrt{N}$
- $b_2+b_1$
- $\mathbf{b_2−b_1}$

### Exercise 12 - Standard Error of the Difference Between Polls
Using what we learned by answering the questions above, what is the standard error of $\bar{Y}_2-\bar{Y}_1$?

**Possible Answers**

- $\mathbf{\sqrt{\sigma_2^2/N_2+\sigma_1^2/N_1}}$
- $\sqrt{\sigma_2/N_2+\sigma_1/N_1}$
- $(\sigma_2^2/N_2+\sigma_1^2/N_1)^2$
- $\sigma_2^2/N_2+\sigma_1^2/N_1$

### Exercise 13 - Compute the Estimates
The answer to the previous question depends on $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$, which we don't know. We learned that we can estimate these values using the sample standard deviation.

Compute the estimates of $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$.

- Group the data by pollster.
- Summarize the standard deviation of the spreads for each of the two pollsters. Name the standard deviation $s$.
- Store the pollster names and standard deviations of the spreads (σ) in an object called $sigma$.

```{r}
# The `polls` data have already been loaded for you. Use the `head` function to examine them.
head(polls)

# Create an object called `sigma` that contains a column for `pollster` and a column for `s`, the standard deviation of the spread
sigma <- polls %>%  group_by(pollster) %>% summarise (s=sd(spread))


# Print the contents of sigma to the console
(sigma)
```
### Exercise 14 - Probability Distribution of the Spread
What does the central limit theorem tell us about the distribution of the differences between the pollster averages, $\bar{Y}_2-\bar{Y}_1$?

**Possible Answers**

- The central limit theorem cannot tell us anything because this difference is not the average of a sample.
- Because $Y_{ij}$ are approximately normal, the averages are normal too.
- **If we assume** $N_2$ **and** $N_1$ **are large enough,** $\bar{Y}_2$ **and** $\bar{Y}_1$**, and their difference, are approximately normal.**
- These data do not contain vectors of 0 and 1, so the central limit theorem does not apply.

### Exercise 15 - Calculate the 95% Confidence Interval of the Spreads
We have constructed a random variable that has expected value $b_2−b_1$, the pollster bias difference. If our model holds, then this random variable has an approximately normal distribution. The standard error of this random variable depends on σ1 and σ2, but we can use the sample standard deviations we computed earlier. We have everything we need to answer our initial question: is $b_2−b_1$ different from 0?

Construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference $b_2$ and $b_1$. Does this interval contain zero?

- Use pipes `%>%` to pass the data $polls$ on to functions that will group by pollster and summarize the average spread, standard deviation, and number of polls per pollster.
- Calculate the estimate by subtracting the average spreads. Save this estimate to a variable called $estimate$.
- Calculate the standard error using the standard deviations of the spreads and the sample size. Save this value to a variable called $se\_hat$.
- Calculate the 95% confidence intervals using the $qnorm$ function. Save the lower and then the upper confidence interval to a variable called $ci$.
```{r}
# The `polls` data have already been loaded for you. Use the `head` function to examine them.
head(polls)

# Create an object called `res` that summarizes the average, standard deviation, and number of polls for the two pollsters.
res <- polls%>% group_by(pollster)%>%summarise(avg=mean(spread),s=sd(spread),n=n())

# Store the difference between the larger average and the smaller in a variable called `estimate`. Print this value to the console.
(estimate <- abs(res$avg[1]-res$avg[2]))

# Store the standard error of the estimates as a variable called `se_hat`. Print this value to the console.
(se_hat <- sqrt(res$s[1]^2/res$n[1] + res$s[2]^2/res$n[2]))

# Calculate the 95% confidence interval of the spreads. Save the lower and then the upper confidence interval to a variable called `ci`.
(ci <- estimate + c(-1,1) * qnorm(0.975) * se_hat)
```
### Exercise 16 - Calculate the P-value
The confidence interval tells us there is relatively strong pollster effect resulting in a difference of about 5%. Random variability does not seem to explain it.

Compute a p-value to relay the fact that chance does not explain the observed pollster effect.

- Use the $pnorm$ function to calculate the probability that a random value is larger than the observed ratio of the estimate to the standard error.
- Multiply the probability by 2, because this is the two-tailed test.
```{r}
# We made an object `res` to summarize the average, standard deviation, and number of polls for the two pollsters.
res <- polls %>% group_by(pollster) %>% 
  summarize(avg = mean(spread), s = sd(spread), N = n()) 

# The variables `estimate` and `se_hat` contain the spread estimates and standard error, respectively.
estimate <- res$avg[2] - res$avg[1]
se_hat <- sqrt(res$s[2]^2/res$N[2] + res$s[1]^2/res$N[1])

# Calculate the p-value
2*(1-pnorm(estimate/se_hat))
```
### Exercise 17 - Comparing Within-Poll and Between-Poll Variability
We compute statistic called the t-statistic by dividing our estimate of $b_2−b_1$ by its estimated standard error:

\[{\bar{Y}_2-\bar{Y}_1}\over {\sqrt{s_2^2/N_2+s_1^2/N_1}}\]

Later we learn will learn of another approximation for the distribution of this statistic for values of $N_2$ and $N_1$ that aren't large enough for the CLT.

Note that our data has more than two pollsters. We can also test for pollster effect using all pollsters, not just two. The idea is to compare the variability across polls to variability within polls. We can construct statistics to test for effects and approximate their distribution. The area of statistics that does this is called Analysis of Variance or ANOVA. We do not cover it here, but ANOVA provides a very useful set of tools to answer questions such as: is there a pollster effect?

Compute the average and standard deviation for each pollster and examine the variability across the averages and how it compares to the variability within the pollsters, summarized by the standard deviation.

- Group the $polls$ data by pollster.
- Summarize the average and standard deviation of the spreads for each pollster.
- Create an object called $var$ that contains three columns: pollster, mean spread, and standard deviation.
Be sure to name the column for mean $avg$ and the column for standard deviation $s$.

```{r}
# Execute the following lines of code to filter the polling data and calculate the spread
polls <- polls_us_election_2016 %>% 
  filter(enddate >= "2016-10-15" &
           state == "U.S.") %>%
  group_by(pollster) %>%
  filter(n() >= 5) %>% 
  mutate(spread = rawpoll_clinton/100 - rawpoll_trump/100) %>%
  ungroup()

# Create an object called `var` that contains columns for the pollster, mean spread, and standard deviation. Print the contents of this object to the console.
(var <- polls%>%group_by(pollster)%>%summarise(avg=mean(spread), s=sd(spread)))
```
## Section 5: Bayesian Statistics 
### Exercise 1 - Statistics in the Courtroom
In 1999 in England [Sally Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Clark) was found guilty of the murder of two of her sons. Both infants were found dead in the morning, one in 1996 and another in 1998, and she claimed the cause of death was sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). No evidence of physical harm was found on the two infants so the main piece of evidence against her was the testimony of Professor Sir Roy Meadow, who testified that the chances of two infants dying of SIDS was 1 in 73 million. He arrived at this figure by finding that the rate of SIDS was 1 in 8,500 and then calculating that the chance of two SIDS cases was 8,500 × 8,500 ≈ 73 million.

Based on what we've learned throughout this course, which statement best describes a potential flaw in Sir Meadow's reasoning?

**Possible Answers**

- **Sir Meadow assumed the second death was independent of the first son being affected, thereby ignoring possible genetic causes.**
- There is no flaw. The multiplicative rule always applies in this way: $Pr(A\ and\ B)=Pr(A)Pr(B)$
- Sir Meadow should have added the probabilities: $Pr(A\ and\ B)=Pr(A)+Pr(B)$
- The rate of SIDS is too low to perform these types of statistics.

### Exercise 2 - Recalculating the SIDS Statistics
Let's assume that there is in fact a genetic component to SIDS and the the probability of $Pr(second\ case\ of\ SIDS∣first\ case\ of\ SIDS)=1/100$, is much higher than 1 in 8,500.

What is the probability of both of Sally Clark's sons dying of SIDS?

- Calculate the probability of both sons dying to SIDS.

```{r}
# Define `Pr_1` as the probability of the first son dying of SIDS
Pr_1 <- 1/8500

# Define `Pr_2` as the probability of the second son dying of SIDS
Pr_2 <- 1/100

# Calculate the probability of both sons dying of SIDS. Print this value to the console.
Pr_1*Pr_2
``` 
### Exercise 3 - Bayes' Rule in the Courtroom
Many press reports stated that the expert claimed the probability of Sally Clark being innocent as 1 in 73 million. Perhaps the jury and judge also interpreted the testimony this way. This probability can be written like this:

\[Pr(mother\ is\ a\ murderer∣two\ children\ found\ dead\ with\ no\ evidence\ of\ harm)\]
Bayes' rule tells us this probability is equal to:

Bayes' rule tells us this probability is equal to:

**Possible Answers**

- $Pr(two\ children\ found\ dead\ with\ no\ evidence\ of\ harm)Pr(mother\ is\ a\ murderer)\over{Pr(two\ children\ found\ dead\ with\ no\ evidence\ of\ harm)}$
- $Pr(two\ children\ found\ dead\ with\ no\ evidence\ of\ harm)Pr(mother\ is\ a\ murderer)$
- $\mathbf{Pr(two\ children\ found\ dead\ with\ no\ evidence\ of\ harm∣mother\ is\ a\ murderer)Pr(mother\ is\ a\ murderer)\over{Pr(two\ children\ found\ dead\ with\ no\ evidence\ of\ harm)}}$
- $1/8500$

### Exercise 4 - Calculate the Probability
Assume that the probability of a murderer finding a way to kill her two children without leaving evidence of physical harm is:

$Pr(two\ children\ found\ dead\ with\ no\ evidence\ of\ harm∣mother\ is\ a\ murderer)=0.50$
Assume that the murder rate among mothers is 1 in 1,000,000.

$Pr(mother\ is\ a\ murderer)=1/1,000,000$
According to Bayes' rule, what is the probability of:

$Pr(mother\ is\ a\ murderer∣two\ children\ found\ dead\ with\ no\ evidence\ of\ harm)$

- Use Bayes' rule to calculate the probability that the mother is a murderer, considering the rates of murdering mothers in the population, the probability that two siblings die of SIDS, and the probability that a murderer kills children without leaving evidence of physical harm.

```{r}
# Define `Pr_1` as the probability of the first son dying of SIDS
Pr_1 <- 1/8500

# Define `Pr_2` as the probability of the second son dying of SIDS
Pr_2 <- 1/100

# Define `Pr_B` as the probability of both sons dying of SIDS
Pr_B <- Pr_1*Pr_2

# Define Pr_A as the rate of mothers that are murderers
Pr_A <- 1/1000000

# Define Pr_BA as the probability that two children die without evidence of harm, given that their mother is a murderer
Pr_BA <- 0.50

# Define Pr_AB as the probability that a mother is a murderer, given that her two children died with no evidence of physical harm. Print this value to the console.
(Pr_AB = Pr_BA * Pr_A / Pr_B)
```
### Exercise 5 - Misuse of Statistics in the Courts
After Sally Clark was found guilty, the Royal Statistical Society issued a statement saying that there was "no statistical basis" for the expert's claim. They expressed concern at the "misuse of statistics in the courts". Eventually, Sally Clark was acquitted in June 2003.

In addition to misusing the multiplicative rule as we saw earlier, what else did Sir Meadow miss?

**Possible Answers**

- He made an arithmetic error in forgetting to divide by the rate of SIDS in siblings.
- **He did not take into account how rare it is for a mother to murder her children.**
- He mixed up the numerator and denominator of Bayes' rule.
- He did not take into account murder rates in the population.

### Exercise 6 - Back to Election Polls
Florida is one of the most closely watched states in the U.S. election because it has many electoral votes and the election is generally close. Create a table with the poll spread results from Florida taken during the last days before the election using the sample code.

The CLT tells us that the average of these spreads is approximately normal. Calculate a spread average and provide an estimate of the standard error.


- Calculate the average of the spreads. Call this average $avg$ in the final table.
- Calculate an estimate of the standard error of the spreads. Call this standard error $se$ in the final table.
- Use the $mean$ and $sd$ functions nested within $summarize$ to find the average and standard deviation of the grouped $spread$ data.
- Save your results in an object called $results$.
```{r}
# Load the libraries and poll data
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data(polls_us_election_2016)

# Create an object `polls` that contains the spread of predictions for each candidate in Florida during the last polling days
polls <- polls_us_election_2016 %>% 
  filter(state == "Florida" & enddate >= "2016-11-04" ) %>% 
  mutate(spread = rawpoll_clinton/100 - rawpoll_trump/100)

# Examine the `polls` object using the `head` function
head(polls)

# Create an object called `results` that has two columns containing the average spread (`avg`) and the standard error (`se`). Print the results to the console.
(results <- polls%>%summarise(avg=mean(spread),se=sd(spread)/sqrt(n())))
```
### Exercise 7 - The Prior Distribution
Assume a Bayesian model sets the prior distribution for Florida's election night spread d to be normal with expected value μ and standard deviation τ.

What are the interpretations of μ and τ?

**Possible Answers**

- μ and τ are arbitrary numbers that let us make probability statements about d.
- **μ and τ summarize what we would predict for Florida before seeing any polls.**
- μ and τ summarize what we want to be true. We therefore set μ at 0.10 and τ at 0.01.
- The choice of prior has no effect on the Bayesian analysis.

### Exercise 8 - Estimate the Posterior Distribution
The CLT tells us that our estimate of the spread $\hat{d}$ has a normal distribution with expected value $d$ and standard deviation $\sigma$, which we calculated in a previous exercise.

Use the formulas for the posterior distribution to calculate the expected value of the posterior distribution if we set $μ=0$ and $τ=0.01$.

- Define $μ$  and $τ$
- Identify which elements stored in the object results represent $σ$ and $Y$
- Estimate $B$ using $σ$ and $τ$
- Estimate the posterior distribution using $B$, $μ$, and $Y$

```{r}
# The results` object has already been loaded. Examine the values stored: `avg` and `se` of the spread
results

# Define `mu` and `tau`
mu <- 0
tau <- 0.01

# Define a variable called `sigma` that contains the standard error in the object `results
(sigma <- results$se)

# Define a variable called `Y` that contains the average in the object `results`
(Y <- results$avg)

# Define a variable `B` using `sigma` and `tau`. Print this value to the console.
(B <- sigma^2/(sigma^2 + tau^2)) 

# Calculate the expected value of the posterior distribution
B*mu + (1-B)*Y
```
### Exercise 9 - Standard Error of the Posterior Distribution
Compute the standard error of the posterior distribution.

- Using the variables we have defined so far, calculate the standard error of the posterior distribution.
- Print this value to the console.

```{r}
# Here are the variables we have defined
mu <- 0
tau <- 0.01
sigma <- results$se
Y <- results$avg
B <- sigma^2 / (sigma^2 + tau^2)

# Compute the standard error of the posterior distribution. Print this value to the console.
sqrt(1/(1/sigma^2+1/tau^2))
```
### Exercise 10- Constructing a Credible Interval
Using the fact that the posterior distribution is normal, create an interval that has a 95% of occurring centered at the posterior expected value. Note that we call these credible intervals.

- Calculate the 95% credible intervals using the $qnorm$ function.
- Save the lower and upper confidence intervals as an object called $ci$. Save the lower confidence interval first.
```{r}
# Here are the variables we have defined in previous exercises
mu <- 0
tau <- 0.01
sigma <- results$se
Y <- results$avg
B <- sigma^2 / (sigma^2 + tau^2)
se <- sqrt( 1/ (1/sigma^2 + 1/tau^2))

# Construct the 95% credible interval. Save the lower and then the upper confidence interval to a variable called `ci`.
(ci <- B*mu + (1-B)*Y + c(-1,1) * qnorm(.975) * se)
```
### Exercise 11 - Odds of Winning Florida
According to this analysis, what was the probability that Trump wins Florida?

- Using the $pnorm$ function, calculate the probability that the spread in Florida was less than 0.

``` {r}
# Assign the expected value of the posterior distribution to the variable `exp_value`
exp_value <- B*mu + (1-B)*Y 

# Assign the standard error of the posterior distribution to the variable `se`
se <- sqrt( 1/ (1/sigma^2 + 1/tau^2))

# Using the `pnorm` function, calculate the probability that the actual spread was less than 0 (in Trump's favor). Print this value to the console.
pnorm(0,exp_value,se)
```
### Exercise 12 - Change the Priors
We had set the prior variance $τ$ to 0.01, reflecting that these races are often close.

Change the prior variance to include values ranging from 0.005 to 0.05 and observe how the probability of Trump winning Florida changes by making a plot.

- Create a vector of values of $taus$ by executing the $sample$ code.
- Create a function using $function(){}$ called $p\_calc$ that takes the value $tau$ as the only argument, then calculates $B$ from $tau$ and $sigma$, and then calculates the probability of Trump winning, as we did in the previous exercise.
- Apply your $p\_calc$ function across all the new values of $taus$.
- Use the $plot$ function to plot $τ$ on the x-axis and the new probabilities on the y-axis.

```{r}
# Define the variables from previous exercises
mu <- 0
sigma <- results$se
Y <- results$avg

# Define a variable `taus` as different values of tau
taus <- seq(0.005, 0.05, len = 100)

# Create a function called `p_calc` that generates `B` and calculates the probability of the spread being less than 0
p_calc <- function(tau) {
  B <- (sigma ^2 /(sigma ^2 + tau^2))
  pnorm(0,B*mu+(1-B)*Y,sqrt(1/(1/sigma^2+1/tau^2)))
}

# Create a vector called `ps` by applying the function `p_calc` across values in `taus`
ps <- sapply(taus, p_calc)

# Plot `taus` on the x-axis and `ps` on the y-axis
plot(taus,ps)
```
## Section 5: Bayesian Statistics - Assessment: Finding a missing airplane

### Background
Bayesian search theory is the use of Bayes' Theorem to find lost objects. It has been used to find planes crashed at sea, sunken submarines, missing people and more. Prior assumptions about the probability of finding the object in various locations are continually revised as the search proceeds.

A search team is tasked with finding a crashed plane. Their initial data suggest the plane is found somewhere within one of four areas with the following probabilities:

The team can search one area per day and will always search the area with the highest probability. When the team searches an area, there is a 90% chance that they find a plane if one is present and a 10% chance that they overlook the plane. (There is always a 100% chance of not finding a plane if one is not present in the area.)

Use Bayes' Theorem to determine where the team should search on the second day if necessary and the probability of finding the plane within 2 days.


### Equation summary
\[Pr(plane\in\ A)=0.2\]
\[Pr(plane\ in\ B)=0.6\] 
\[Pr(plane\ in\ C)=0.15\]
\[Pr(plane\ in\ D)=0.05\] 
\[Pr(plane\ not\ found\ in\ area | plane\ in\ area)=0.1\]
\[Pr(plane\ not\ found\ in\ area | plane\ in\ different\ area)=1\]

**Pre-exercise code**

Report your answers to 3 significant digits:

```
options(digits = 3)
```
### Question 1
On day 1, the team will search area B. The probability that the plane is in area B is $Pr(plane\ in\ B) = 0.6$.

What is the probability the plane is not in B?
```{r}
pr_B <- 0.6
1 - pr_B
```

What is the probability the plane is in B but is not found?
```{r}
pr_missed <- 0.1
pr_B * pr_missed
```

What is $Pr(plane\ not\ found\ in\ B)$ , the probability the plane is not found in B on day 1?
```{r}
1 - pr_B + pr_B*pr_missed
```
### Question 2
Suppose the plane will not be found on day 1. What is the equation for  $Pr(plane\ in\ B | plane\ not\ found\ in\ B)$ , the posterior probability that the plane is in area B given that it is not found in area B on day 1?

Select the correct equation for  $Pr(plane\ in\ B | plane\ not\ found\ in\ B)$ :
 
- $Pr(plane\ not\ found\ in\ B)×Pr(plane\ in\ B)\over{Pr(plane\ not\ found\ in\ B | plane\ in\ B)}$
- $\mathbf{Pr(plane\ not\ found\ in\ B | plane\ in\ B)× Pr(plane\ in\ B)\over{Pr(plane\ not\ found\ in\ B)}}$
- $Pr(plane\ not\ found\ in\ B | plane\ in\ B)×Pr(plane\ not\ found\ in\ A)\over{Pr(plane\ not\ in\ A)}$
- $Pr(plane\ not\ found\ in\ B | plane\ in\ B)×Pr(plane\ not\ found\ in\ B)\over{Pr(plane\ in\ B)}$

### Question 3
Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the posterior probabilities of finding the plane in each of the 4 grid locations. Recall that area B will be searched on day 1.

What is the posterior probability that the plane is in area B given that it is not found on day 1?
```{r}
pr_B <- 0.6
          pr_missed <- 0.1    # prob plane in B but not found
          pr_not_found <-  1 - pr_B + pr_B*pr_missed
          pr_missed * pr_B / pr_not_found
```
What is the posterior probability that the plane is in area C given that it is not found on day 1?
```{r}
pr_C <- 0.15
          pr_missed_not_present <- 1
          pr_C * pr_missed_not_present / pr_not_found

```
Which area has the highest posterior probability and should be searched on day 2?

```{r}
# Calculate the posterior probabilities for A and D, then compare the 4 posterior probabilities from this problem and select the highest probability region:

pr_A <- 0.2
pr_D <- 0.05

pr_A_post <- pr_A * pr_missed_not_present / pr_not_found
pr_B_post <- pr_missed * pr_B / pr_not_found
pr_C_post <- pr_C * pr_missed_not_present / pr_not_found
pr_D_post <- pr_D * pr_missed_not_present / pr_not_found

results <- c(pr_A_post, pr_B_post, pr_C_post, pr_D_post)
names(results) <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
names(which.max(results))
```
### Question 4
Before the search begins, you have been asked to report the probability that you find the plane within two days.

What is the probability of finding the plane on the first day?
```{r}
# This is the probability of the plane being in B times the probability of a successful search:
pr_B <- 0.6
          pr_missed <- 0.1    # prob of failed search
          pr_B * (1 - pr_missed)

```

What is the probability that the plane is not found on the first day but is found on the second day?
On day 2, you will search the region that had the highest posterior probability in question 3. Make sure you multiply the probability of a successful search on day 2 by the probability that the plane is not found on day 1.
```{r}
# This is the posterior probability that the plane is in A given that it was not found on day 1, times the probability of a successful search.

# use maximum posterior probability from previous question: region A
pr_A <- 0.2
pr_missed <- 0.1    # prob plane in B but not found
pr_not_found_in_B <-  1 - pr_B + pr_B*pr_missed
pr_missed_not_present <- 1
pr_A_post <- pr_A * pr_missed_not_present / pr_not_found

# probability plane found on day 2
pr_found_in_A <- pr_A_post*(1-pr_missed)

# probability plane not found on day 1 but found on day 2
pr_not_found_in_B * pr_found_in_A
```


What is the probability that the plane is found within 2 days?


```{r}
# This is the sum of the probability of finding the plane on day 1 and the probability of not finding the plane on day 1 but finding it on day 2.
pr_B*(1-pr_missed) + pr_A_post*(1-pr_missed)
```

## Section 6: Assessment 6.1: Election Forecasting 
### Exercise 1 - Confidence Intervals of Polling Data
For each poll in the polling data set, use the CLT to create a 95% confidence interval for the spread. Create a new table called cis that contains columns for the lower and upper limits of the confidence intervals.

- Use pipes $\%>\%$ to pass the $poll$ object on to the $mutate$ function, which creates new variables.
- Create a variable called $X\_hat$ that contains the estimate of the proportion of Clinton voters for each poll.
- Create a variable called $se$ that contains the standard error of the spread.
- Calculate the confidence intervals using the $qnorm$ function and your calculated $se$.
- Use the $select$ function to keep the following columns: $state$, $startdate$, $enddate$, $pollster$, $grade$, $spread$, $lower$, $upper$.

```{r}
# Load the libraries and data
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data("polls_us_election_2016")

# Create a table called `polls` that filters by  state, date, and reports the spread
polls <- polls_us_election_2016 %>% 
  filter(state != "U.S." & enddate >= "2016-10-31") %>% 
  mutate(spread = rawpoll_clinton/100 - rawpoll_trump/100)

# Create an object called `cis` that has the columns indicated in the instructions
cis <- polls%>% mutate(
  X_hat = (spread + 1)/2, 
    se  = 2 * sqrt(X_hat*(1-X_hat)/samplesize), 
  lower = spread -  qnorm(0.975) * se, 
  upper = spread +  qnorm(0.975) * se) %>% 
  select(state, startdate, enddate, pollster, grade, spread, lower, upper)

head(cis)
```
### Exercise 2 - Compare to Actual Results
You can add the final result to the $cis$ table you just created using the $left\_join$ function as shown in the sample code.

Now determine how often the 95% confidence interval includes the actual result.

- Create an object called $p\_hits$ that contains the proportion of intervals that contain the actual spread using the following steps.
- Use the $mutate$ function to create a new variable called $hit$ that contains a logical vector for whether the $actual\_spread$ falls between the $lower$ and $upper$ confidence intervals.
- Summarize the proportion of values in $hit$ that are true as a variable called $proportion\_hits$ using the mean function.

```{r}
# Add the actual results to the `cis` data set
add <- results_us_election_2016 %>% 
  mutate(actual_spread = clinton/100 - trump/100) %>%
  select(state, actual_spread)
ci_data <- cis %>% 
  mutate(state = as.character(state)) %>% 
  left_join(add, by = "state")

# Create an object called `p_hits` that summarizes the proportion of confidence intervals that contain the actual value. Print this object to the console.
(p_hits <- ci_data %>% 
    mutate(hit= actual_spread >= lower & actual_spread <= upper) %>%
    summarise(proportion_hits=mean(hit)))
```
### Exercise 3 - Stratify by Pollster and Grade
Now find the proportion of hits for each pollster. Show only pollsters with at least 5 polls and order them from best to worst. Show the number of polls conducted by each pollster and the FiveThirtyEight grade of each pollster.

- Create an object called $p\_hits$ that contains the proportion of intervals that contain the actual spread using the following steps.
- Use the $mutate$ function to create a new variable called $hit$ that contains a logical vector for whether the $actual\_spread$ falls between the $lower$ and $upper$ confidence intervals.
- Use the $group\_by$ function to group the data by pollster.
- Use the $filter$ function to filter for pollsters that have at least 5 polls.
- Summarize the proportion of values in $hit$ that are true as a variable called $proportion\_hits$. Also create new variables for the number of polls by each pollster ($n$) using the $n()$ function and the grade of each poll ($grade$) by taking the first row of the grade column.
- Use the $arrange$ function to arrange the $proportion\_hits$ in descending order.

```{r}
# The `cis` data have already been loaded for you
add <- results_us_election_2016 %>% 
  mutate(actual_spread = clinton/100 - trump/100) %>% 
  select(state, actual_spread)
ci_data <- cis %>% 
  mutate(state = as.character(state)) %>% 
  left_join(add, by = "state")

# Create an object called `p_hits` that summarizes the proportion of hits for each pollster that has at least 5 polls.
(p_hits <- ci_data %>%
    mutate(hit = actual_spread >= lower & actual_spread<=upper) %>%
    group_by(pollster) %>% 
    filter(n() >= 5) %>% 
    summarise(proportion_hits = mean(hit), n = n(), grade = grade[1]) %>%
    arrange(desc(proportion_hits)))
```
### Exercise 4 - Stratify by State
Repeat the previous exercise, but instead of pollster, stratify by state. Here we can't show grades.

- Create an object called $p\_hits$ that contains the proportion of intervals that contain the actual spread using the following steps.
- Use the $mutate$ function to create a new variable called $hit$ that contains a logical vector for whether the $actual\_spread$ falls between the $lower$ and $upper$ confidence intervals.
- Use the $group\_by$ function to group the data by state.
- Use the $filter$ function to filter for states that have more than 5 polls.
- Summarize the proportion of values in $hit$ that are true as a variable called $proportion\_hits$. Also create new variables for the number of polls in each state using the $n()$ function.
- Use the $arrange$ function to arrange the $proportion\_hits$ in descending order.

```{r}
# The `cis` data have already been loaded for you
add <- results_us_election_2016 %>% 
  mutate(actual_spread = clinton/100 - trump/100) %>% 
  select(state, actual_spread)
ci_data <- cis %>% 
  mutate(state = as.character(state)) %>%
  left_join(add, by = "state")

# Create an object called `p_hits` that summarizes the proportion of hits for each state that has more than 5 polls.
(p_hits <- ci_data %>%
    mutate(hit = actual_spread >= lower & actual_spread <= upper) %>%
    group_by(state) %>%
    filter(state > 5) %>%
    summarise(proportion_hits = mean(hit), n = n()) %>%
    arrange(desc(proportion_hits)))
```

### Exercise 5- Plotting Prediction Results
Make a barplot based on the result from the previous exercise.

- Reorder the states in order of the proportion of hits.
- Using $ggplot$, set the aesthetic with state as the x-variable and proportion of hits as the y-variable.
- Use $geom\_bar$ to indicate that we want to plot a barplot. Specifcy $stat = "identity"$ to indicate that the height of the bar should match the value.
- Use $coord\_flip$ to flip the axes so the states are displayed from top to bottom and proportions are displayed from left to right.

```{r}
# The `p_hits` data have already been loaded for you. Use the `head` function to examine it.
head(p_hits)

# Make a barplot of the proportion of hits for each state
p_hits%>%arrange(proportion_hits) %>%
  ggplot(aes(state,proportion_hits)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip()
```

### Exercise 6 - Predicting the Winner
Even if a forecaster's confidence interval is incorrect, the overall predictions will do better if they correctly called the right winner.

Add two columns to the $cis$ table by computing, for each poll, the difference between the predicted spread and the actual spread, and define a column $hit$ that is true if the signs are the same.

- Use the $mutate$ function to add two new variables to the $cis$ object: $error$ and $hit$.
- For the $error$ variable, subtract the actual spread from the spread.
- For the $hit$ variable, return "TRUE" if the poll predicted the actual winner. Use the $sign$ function to check if their signs match - learn more with $?sign$.
- Save the new table as an object called $errors$.
- Use the $tail$ function to examine the last 6 rows of $errors$.

```{r}
# The `cis` data have already been loaded. Examine it using the `head` function.
cis <- cis %>% 
  left_join(results_us_election_2016) %>% 
  mutate(actual_spread = clinton/100 - trump/100)

head(cis)

# Create an object called `errors` that calculates the difference between the predicted and actual spread and indicates if the correct winner was predicted
errors <- cis %>% mutate(
  error = spread - actual_spread, 
  hit   = sign(spread) == sign(actual_spread))

# Examine the last 6 rows of `errors`
tail(errors)
```
### Exercise 7 - Plotting Prediction Results
Create an object called $p\_hits$ that contains the proportion of instances when the sign of the actual spread matches the predicted spread for states with more than 5 polls.

Make a barplot based on the result from the previous exercise that shows the proportion of times the sign of the spread matched the actual result for the data in $p\_hits$.

- Use the $group\_by$ function to group the data by state.
- Use the $filter$ function to filter for states that have more than 5 polls.
- Summarize the proportion of values in $hit$ that are true as a variable called $proportion\_hits$. Also create a variable called $n$ for the number of polls in each state using the $n()$ function.
- To make the plot, follow these steps:
- Reorder the states in order of the proportion of hits.
- Using $ggplot$, set the aesthetic with state as the x-variable and proportion of hits as the y-variable.
- Use $geom\_bar$ to indicate that we want to plot a barplot.
- Use $coord\_flip$ to flip the axes so the states are displayed from top to bottom and proportions are displayed from left to right.

```{r}
# Create an object called `errors` that calculates the difference between the predicted and actual spread and indicates if the correct winner was predicted
errors <- cis %>% mutate(error = spread - actual_spread, hit = sign(spread) == sign(actual_spread))

# Create an object called `p_hits` that summarizes the proportion of hits for each state that has more than 5 polls
p_hits <- errors%>%group_by(state)%>%filter(n()>5)%>%summarise(proportion_hits=mean(hit), n=n())


# Make a barplot of the proportion of hits for each state
p_hits%>% arrange(proportion_hits) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(state,proportion_hits))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+
  coord_flip()
```

### Exercise 8 - Plotting the Errors
In the previous graph, we see that most states' polls predicted the correct winner 100% of the time. Only a few states polls' were incorrect more than 25% of the time. Wisconsin got every single poll wrong. In Pennsylvania and Michigan, more than 90% of the polls had the signs wrong.

Make a histogram of the errors. What is the median of these errors?

- Use the $hist$ function to generate a histogram of the errors
- Use the $median$ function to compute the median error

```{r}
# The `errors` data have already been loaded. Examine them using the `head` function.
head(errors)

# Generate a histogram of the error
hist(errors$error)

# Calculate the median of the errors. Print this value to the console.
(median(errors$error))
```
### Exercise 9- Plot Bias by State
We see that, at the state level, the median error was slightly in favor of Clinton. The distribution is not centered at 0, but at 0.037. This value represents the general bias we described in an earlier section.

Create a boxplot to examine if the bias was general to all states or if it affected some states differently. Filter the data to include only pollsters with grades B+ or higher.

- Use the $filter$ function to filter the data for polls with grades equal to A+, A, A-, or B+.
- Use the $reorder$ function to order the state data by error.
- Using $ggplot$, set the aesthetic with state as the x-variable and error as the y-variable.
- Use $geom\_boxplot$ to indicate that we want to plot a boxplot.
- Use $geom\_point$ to add data points as a layer.

```{r}
# The `errors` data have already been loaded. Examine them using the `head` function.
head(errors)

# Create a boxplot showing the errors by state for polls with grades B+ or higher
errors%>%filter(grade %in% c("A+", "A", "A-","B+"))%>%
        ggplot(aes(state,error))+
        geom_boxplot()+
        geom_point()
```

### Exercise 10 - Filter Error Plot
Some of these states only have a few polls. Repeat the previous exercise to plot the errors for each state, but only include states with five good polls or more.

- Use the $filter$ function to filter the data for polls with grades equal to A+, A, A-, or B+.
- Group the filtered data by state using $group\_by$.
- Use the $filter$ function to filter the data for states with at least 5 polls.
- Use the $reorder$ function to order the state data by error.
- Using $ggplot$, set the aesthetic with state as the x-variable and error as the y-variable.
- Use $geom\_box$ to indicate that we want to plot a boxplot.
- Use $geom\_point$ to add data points as a layer.

```{r}
# The `errors` data have already been loaded. Examine them using the `head` function.
head(errors)

# Create a boxplot showing the errors by state for states with at least 5 polls with grades B+ or higher
errors%>%filter(grade %in% c("A+","A","A-","B+"))%>%
group_by(state)%>%
filter(n()>5)%>%
ggplot(aes(state,error))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_point()
```

## Section 6: Assessment 6.2: The t-Distribution
### Exercise 1 - Using the t-Distribution
We know that, with a normal distribution, only 5% of values are more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean.

Calculate the probability of seeing t-distributed random variables being more than 2 in absolute value when the degrees of freedom are 3.

- Use the $pt$ function to calculate the probability of seeing a value less than or equal to the argument. Your output should be a single value.

```{r}
# Calculate the probability of seeing t-distributed random variables being more than 2 in absolute value when 'df = 3'.
2*pt(-2,3)
```

### Exercise 2 - Plotting the t-distribution
Now use $sapply$ to compute the same probability for degrees of freedom from 3 to 50.

Make a plot and notice when this probability converges to the normal distribution's 5%.

- Make a vector called $df$ that contains a sequence of numbers from 3 to 50.
- Using $function$, make a function called $pt\_func$ that recreates the calculation for the probability that a value is greater than 2 as an absolute value for any given degrees of freedom.
- Use $sapply$ to apply the $pt\_func$ function across all values contained in $df$. Call these probabilities $probs$.
- Use the $plot$ function to plot $df$ on the x-axis and $probs$ on the y-axis.

```{r}
# Generate a vector 'df' that contains a sequence of numbers from 3 to 50
df <- 3:50

# Make a function called 'pt_func' that calculates the probability that a value is more than |2| for any degrees of freedom 
pt_func <- function(x) 2*pt(-2,x)

# Generate a vector 'probs' that uses the `pt_func` function to calculate the probabilities
probs <- sapply(df,pt_func)

# Plot 'df' on the x-axis and 'probs' on the y-axis
plot(df,probs)
```

### Exercise 3 - Sampling From the Normal Distribution
In a previous section, we repeatedly took random samples of 50 heights from a distribution of heights. We noticed that about 95% of the samples had confidence intervals spanning the true population mean.

Re-do this Monte Carlo simulation, but now instead of $N=50$, use $N=15$. Notice what happens to the proportion of hits.

- Use the $replicate$ function to carry out the simulation. Specify the number of times you want the code to run and, within brackets, the three lines of code that should run.
- First use the $sample$ function to randomly sample $N$ values from $x$.
- Second, create a vector called $interval$ that calculates the 95% confidence interval for the sample. You will use the $qnorm$ function.
- Third, use the $between$ function to determine if the population mean $mu$ is contained between the confidence intervals.
- Save the results of the Monte Carlo function to a vector called $res$.
- Use the $mean$ function to determine the proportion of hits in $res$.

```{r}
# Load the neccessary libraries and data
library(dslabs)
library(dplyr)
data(heights)

# Use the sample code to generate 'x', a vector of male heights
x <- heights %>% filter(sex == "Male") %>%
  .$height

# Create variables for the mean height 'mu', the sample size 'N', and the number of times the simulation should run 'B'
mu <- mean(x)
N <- 15
B <- 10000

# Use the `set.seed` function to make sure your answer matches the expected result after random sampling
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")

# Generate a logical vector 'res' that contains the results of the simulations
res <- replicate(B,{
  X <- sample(x,N,replace=TRUE)
  interval <- mean(X) + c(-1,1) * qnorm(0.975) * sd(X)/sqrt(N)
  between(mu,interval[1],interval[2])
})
# Calculate the proportion of times the simulation produced values within the 95% confidence interval. Print this value to the console.
mean(res)
```
### Exercise 4 - Sampling from the t-Distribution
$N=15$ is not that big. We know that heights are normally distributed, so the t-distribution should apply. Repeat the previous Monte Carlo simulation using the t-distribution instead of using the normal distribution to construct the confidence intervals.

What are the proportion of 95% confidence intervals that span the actual mean height now?

- Use the $replicate$ function to carry out the simulation. Specify the number of times you want the code to run and, within brackets, the three lines of code that should run.
- First use the $sample$ function to randomly sample $N$ values from $x$.
- Second, create a vector called $interval$ that calculates the 95% confidence interval for the sample. Remember to use the $qt$ function this time to generate the confidence interval.
- Third, use the $between$ function to determine if the population mean $mu$ is contained between the confidence intervals.
- Save the results of the Monte Carlo function to a vector called $res$.
- Use the $mean$ function to determine the proportion of hits in $res$.

```{r}
# The vector of filtered heights 'x' has already been loaded for you. Calculate the mean.
mu <- mean(x)

# Use the same sampling parameters as in the previous exercise.
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding")
N <- 15
B <- 10000

# Generate a logical vector 'res' that contains the results of the simulations using the t-distribution
res <- replicate(B,{
  X <- sample(x,N,replace=TRUE)
  interval <- mean(X) + c(-1,1) * qt(0.975,N-1) * sd(X)/sqrt(N)
  between(mu,interval[1],interval[2])
})

# Calculate the proportion of times the simulation produced values within the 95% confidence interval. Print this value to the console.
mean(res)

### Exercise 5 - Why the t-Distribution?
Why did the t-distribution confidence intervals work so much better?

**Possible Answers**

- **The t-distribution takes the variability into account and generates larger confidence intervals.**
- Because the t-distribution shifts the intervals in the direction towards the actual mean.
- This was just a chance occurrence. If we run it again, the CLT will work better.
- The t-distribution is always a better approximation than the normal distribution.

## Section 7: Association and Chi-Squared Tests
### Exercise 1 - Comparing Proportions of Hits
In a previous exercise, we determined whether or not each poll predicted the correct winner for their state in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Each poll was also assigned a grade by the poll aggregator. Now we're going to determine if polls rated A- made better predictions than polls rated C-.

In this exercise, filter the errors data for just polls with grades A- and C-. Calculate the proportion of times each grade of poll predicted the correct winner.

- Filter $errors$ for grades A- and C-.
- Group the data by $grade$ and $hit$.
- Summarize the number of hits for each grade.
- Generate a two-by-two table containing the number of hits and misses for each grade. Try using the $spread$ function to generate this table.
- Calculate the proportion of times each grade was correct.

```{r}
# The 'errors' data have already been loaded. Examine them using the `head` function.
head(errors)

# Generate an object called 'totals' that contains the numbers of good and bad predictions for polls rated A- and C-
totals <- errors %>%
  filter(grade %in% c("A-","C-")) %>%
  group_by(grade, hit) %>%
  summarise(score = n()) %>%
  summarise(Right = score[.$grade=="C-" & .$hit=="TRUE"],
            Wrong = score[.$grade=="C-" & .$hit=="FALSE"])
#str(totals$score[totals$grade=="C-" & totals$hit==TRUE])

#,C-wrong=,A_right=,A_wrong=)
totals
# Print the proportion of hits for grade A- polls to the console
totals$Right[totals$grade=="A-"]/(totals$Right[totals$grade=="A-"]+totals$Wrong[totals$grade=="A-"])

# Print the proportion of hits for grade C- polls to the console
totals$Right[totals$grade=="C-"]/(totals$Right[totals$grade=="C-"]+totals$Wrong[totals$grade=="C-"])
```
### Exercise 2 - Chi-squared Test
We found that the A- polls predicted the correct winner about 80% of the time in their states and C- polls predicted the correct winner about 86% of the time.

Use a chi-squared test to determine if these proportions are different.

- Use the $chisq.test$ function to perform the chi-squared test. Save the results to an object called $chisq\_test$.
- Print the p-value of the test to the console.

```{r}
totals <- structure(list(hit = c(FALSE, TRUE), 
                         `C-` = c(50L, 311L), 
                         `A-` = c(26L, 106L)),
                    .Names = c("hit", "C-", "A-"), 
                    class = c("tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"),
                    row.names = c(NA, -2L))
# The 'totals' data have already been loaded. Examine them using the `head` function.
head(totals)

# Perform a chi-squared test on the hit data. Save the results as an object called 'chisq_test'.
chisq_test <- totals %>%
  select(-hit) %>%
  chisq.test()

# Print the p-value of the chi-squared test to the console
chisq_test$p.value
```

### Exercise 3 - Odds Ratio Calculation
It doesn't look like the grade A- polls performed significantly differently than the grade C- polls in their states.

Calculate the odds ratio to determine the magnitude of the difference in performance between these two grades of polls.

- Calculate the odds that a grade C- poll predicts the correct winner. Save this result to a variable called $odds\_C$.
- Calculate the odds that a grade A- poll predicts the correct winner. Save this result to a variable called $odds\_A$.
- Calculate the odds ratio that tells us how many times larger the odds of a grade A- poll is at predicting the winner than a grade C- poll.

```{r}
# The 'totals' data have already been loaded. Examine them using the `head` function.
head(totals)

# Generate a variable called `odds_C` that contains the odds of getting the prediction right for grade C- polls
odds_C <- (totals$`C-`[2]/sum(totals$`C-`))/(totals$`C-`[1]/sum(totals$`C-`))

# Generate a variable called `odds_A` that contains the odds of getting the prediction right for grade A- polls
odds_A <- (totals$`A-`[2]/sum(totals$`A-`))/(totals$`A-`[1]/sum(totals$`A-`))

# Calculate the odds ratio to determine how many times larger the odds ratio is for grade A- polls than grade C- polls
odds_A/odds_C
```
### Exercise 4 - Significance
We did not find meaningful differences between the poll results from grade A- and grade C- polls in this subset of the data, which only contains polls for about a week before the election. Imagine we expanded our analysis to include all election polls and we repeat our analysis. In this hypothetical scenario, we get that the p-value for the difference in prediction success if 0.0015 and the odds ratio describing the effect size of the performance of grade A- over grade B- polls is 1.07.

Based on what we learned in the last section, which statement reflects the best interpretation of this result?

**Possible Answers**

- The p-value is below 0.05, so there is a significant difference. Grade A- polls are significantly better at predicting winners.
- The p-value is too close to 0.05 to call this a significant difference. We do not observe a difference in performance.
- **The p-value is below 0.05, but the odds ratio is very close to 1. There is not a scientifically significant difference in performance.**
- The p-value is below 0.05 and the odds ratio indicates that grade A- polls perform significantly better than grade C- polls.
